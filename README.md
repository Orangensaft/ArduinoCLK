Arduino Alarm Clock using TinyRTC, a HD44780 and a Buzzer

I'm building a small Lego Alarm Clock using an Arduino UNO, an TinyRTC, a HD44780, a buzzer and a DHT22.
Currently planned features:

-Show Time/Date (Works)
-Show Temperature (Works)
-Of course a alarm-function (Works)
-Automatic backlight timeout because that LCD is kinda bright (Workis)
-customisations like rearrange the stuff shown on LCD, backlight timeout etc. (Works)
